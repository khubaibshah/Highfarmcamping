# Getting Started
## Clone The Repository
Ensure you have the latest version of Git installed on your system. Open a Git CMD Prompt and change directory to your desired location.
`git clone https://www.github.com/TomPlum/highfarmcamping`

## Install the Relevant NPM Packages
There are number of packages required by the application that must be installed before it can be run. To install a package you must first ensure you have the latest version of NodeJS installed on your system. Open a NodeJS Command Prompt window and change the working directory to the location of the cloned repository. `npm install package_name --save` where 'package_name' is the name of the NPM package. The required packages are as follows;
* `npm i async --save`
* `npm i bcrypt-nodejs --save`
* `npm i body-parser --save`
* `npm i connect-flash --save`
* `npm i cookie-parse --save`
* `npm i express --save`
* `npm i express-session --save`
* `npm i forever --save`
* `npm i morgan --save`
* `npm i mysql --save`
* `npm i node-async-loop --save`
* `npm i nodemailer --save`
* `npm i passport --save`
* `npm i passport-local --save`
* `npm i path --save`
* `npm i pug --save`
* `npm i serve-favicon --save`
* `npm i xoauth2 --save`

`--save` ensures that the dependencies in `package.json` are kept up to date with the latest versions of the packages.

## Start the Application
Open a NodeJS Command Prompt window. Change directory to the location of the cloned git repository. Run the command `npm start`. Should this command fail, try `node bin/www`.

## Logging into the Application
Accesing the root route of the application (`localhost:3000/` or `https://highfarmcamping.com/`) will greet you with a landing page. Here you may login or register. If you do not have an account, you may register one and login to access the application.

## Changing the Server Port
Should you wish to change the port that the application listens on, possibly due to conflicts, you can simply alter the value in the `bin/www` file. Line 15 `let port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '3000');` delcares a variable with the given port.

## Access the Production Server
Use an SSH client such as PuTTY to remote access the CentOS Server @ 216.189.151.23. Once logged in with an authenticated user, change directory to the repository using `cd /camping`. 

### Fetch Latest Version To Server
Once in the `/camping` directory on the server, run `git fetch --all`. It may ask to authenticate the fetch. Then, `git reset --hard origin/master` to reset the HEAD to the latest commit from the GitHub Repository. Finally, to restart the process to see the changes live, restart the forever process. Run `forever list` to see a list of running forever processes. Then `forever restart PID` where `PID` is the Process ID from the list.
